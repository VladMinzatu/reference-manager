# reference-manager

## Working with the db locally

We use `slite3` as our db and [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) to manage migrations.

Follow the instructions on the goose page above to install the tool and add it to your path.

Next, let's look at some useful instructions:

Initialising the db by running migrations:

```
goose sqlite3 db/references.db -dir db/migrations up
```

Connecting to our db to run queries:

```
sqlite3 db/references.db

sqlite> .tables
```

Tearing down the db:

```
goose sqlite3 db/references.db -dir db/migrations down
```
